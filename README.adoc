Roadmap to finish MVP

Top Priority:

1. Read multiple table SQL and Map Select column with corresponding table so that we can find out column data type accurately.
DONE with limitation: For now we assume alias is same name as of table name.

2. Add support to generate DTO for multiple tables, need to create a method that takes SQL and ddls and can provide column name vs datatype mapping.
DONE

3. Generate Spring boot application classes

    directory structure     DONE
    pom.xml                 DONE
    SpringBootApplication.  DONE
    Controller              DONE
    Controller              WIP Add support for request params which is derived from SQL where clause.
    DAO with spring-jdbc.   WIP
    Check Rest Annotations.

3.1 Write code to get Java type from SQL type, for this update class SQLServerDataTypeEnum, add additional data types.

4. Test SubQuery that is treated as table with alias.

5. Table ddl should be defined in a file and when application starts it should create a map of table name vs CreateTable object.

Low Priority:

1. Implement JSQLParser as per recommendation, find if current approach has any limitations.
2. Add support for SQL Server data types in SQLServerDataTypeEnum class.
3. Add support for SQL select columns having as clause.
