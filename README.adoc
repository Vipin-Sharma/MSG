### MSG (Microservice Generator)

This is a tool for generating microservices. You need to provide SQL and DDL info, and it will generate Rest API that exposes data from SQL. It is a work in progress.

    Technologies used:
        - Java 18
        - JSQLParser
        - JavaPoet

### Usages Instructions

    1. Run JavaServiceGenerator.java to generate spring boot application. Application will be generated in the /tmp/generated directory. Next steps (2 and 3) help you to start generated spring boot application.
    3. cd /tmp/generated
    4. mvn clean package spring-boot:run

For now SQL and DDL is hardcoded in JavaServiceGenerator.java, we can change SQL and DDL in JavaServiceGenerator.java to test different scenarios.

### Roadmap to finish MVP

#### List of tasks given in order of priority:

1. Read multiple table SQL and Map Select column with corresponding table so that we can find out column data type accurately. DONE

2. Add support to generate DTO for multiple tables, need to create a method that takes SQL and ddls and can provide column name vs datatype mapping. DONE

3. Generate Spring boot application classes

    directory structure     DONE
    pom.xml                 DONE
    SpringBootApplication.  DONE
    Controller              DONE
    Controller              DONE
    DAO with spring-jdbc.   DONE
    Check Rest Annotations. DONE

4. Add support for SQL having as clause in select columns. DONE.

5. plainSelect.getWhere(), plainSelect.getJoins() out of these wherever we have literals (city = 'Jaipur') use that to pass as parameter to rest API and SQL. DONE

6. Write code to convert Java type from SQL type, for this update class SQLServerDataTypeEnum. Added basic types need to add additional data types. Need to add tests along with new types, may be a DDL and SQL having all these types. WIP

7. Table ddl should be defined in a file and when application starts it should create a map of table name vs CreateTable object. TODO

8. Test SubQuery that is treated as table with alias. TODO

9. Schema name is ignored in ReadDDL class so Table names should be unique across all schemas. This is a limitation right now, should be fixed. TODO

10. Add support for grouping by and having aggregate functions in select clause. TODO

11. Decide on license type(probably apache 2) and add it in repository. TODO

12. Usages of code like `selectItem.getASTNode()` is not good idea replace it with better alternative, like `selectItem.getExpression()` and depending upon type of expression, call appropriate method to retrieve column/alias/table name. TODO

13. Check and document why SQL and DDL converted in upper case. If it makes sense, SQL and DDL should be converted in upper case as first step. TODO


13. Remove sysout and add logger (Slf4j). TODO

#### Low Priority tasks:

1. Implement JSQLParser as per recommendation, find if current approach has any limitations. WIP
2. Add support for SQL select columns having as clause. DONE

#### List of tasks for new contributors:

See https://github.com/users/Vipin-Sharma/projects/1

#### Caution while coding:
Always convert SQL server data type into UPPER case before use. TODO Fix this by using converting to UPPER case in code.
