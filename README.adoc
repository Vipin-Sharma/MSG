Roadmap to finish MVP

Top Priority:

1. Read multiple table SQL and Map Select column with corresponding table so that we can find out column data type accurately.
Done with limitation: For now we assume alias is same name as of table name.

2. Test SubQuery that is treated as table with alias.

3. Table ddl should be defined in a file and when application starts it should create a map of table name vs CreateTable object.

Low Priority:

1. Implement JSQLParser as per recommendation, find if current approach has any limitations.
2. Add support for SQL Server data types in SQLServerDataTypeEnum class.
